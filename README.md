**TimeLauncher** is the executable launcher for *Windows* that allows you to set a time checkpoint at which to set the system time before launching the executable.

Usage is intended to allow the use of deprecated *Windows* programs.

We strongly advise against the use of this launcher for the illegal use of programs for which you do not have a valid license.
